# 49 - Group Anagrams
Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]
```

**Constraints:**
- <code>1 <= strs.length <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- <code>0 <= strs[i].length <= 100</code>
- `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
