# Summations
Given a sequence $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ of numbers, where $n$ is a nonnegative integer, the finite sum $a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n$ can be expressed as:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k
$$

If $n = 0$, the value of the summation is defined to be $0$. The value of a finite series is always well defined, and the order in which its terms are added does not matter.
