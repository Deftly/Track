# Summations
Given a sequence $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ of numbers, where $n$ is a nonnegative integer, the finite sum $a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n$ can be expressed as:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k
$$

If $n = 0$, the value of the summation is defined to be $0$. The value of a finite series is always well defined, and the order in which its terms are added does not matter.

Given an infinite sequence $a_1, a_2, \ldots$ of numbers, we can write their infinite sum $a_1 + a_2 + \cdots$ as:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k
$$

which means:

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k
$$

If the limit does not exist, the series diverges, and otherwise, it converges. The terms of a convergent series cannot always be added in any order. You can, however, rearrange the terms of an absolutely convergent series, that is, a series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k$ for which the series:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} |a_k|
$$

also converges.
