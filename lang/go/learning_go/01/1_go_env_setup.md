## Installing the Go Tools
The latest version of the Go Tools can be found on the Go website. Windows(üôÅ) and Mac OS users can simply download the .msi or .pkg installers respectively.

For Linux systems the installers are gzipped TAR files that expand to a directory named go. Start by removing any previous Go installs and extract the archive into /usr/local/go.
```
$ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go
$ sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Next add */usr/local/go/bin* to the `PATH` environment variable. Add the following to either  *$HOME/.profile* or */etc/profile*(for a system-wide install) for whichever shell you may be using(bash, zsh, fish, etc.):
```
export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/go/bin
```

Verify your install with the following command:
```
$ go version
```

### Go Tooling
All of the Go development tools are accessed via the `go` command. There's a compiler(`go build`), code formatter(`go fmt`), dependency manager(`go mod`), test runner(`go test`), a tool that scans for common coding errors(`go vet`), and more.

## Your First Go Program
Next we'll cover the basics of writing a Go program.

### Making a Go Module
To create a module you'll first need a directory, once inside run the following command to mark it as a Go module:
```
$ go mod init hello_world
go: creating new go.mod: module hello_world
```
